      <description>Elizabeth Kolbert: A journalist at The New Yorker who has travelled in many ecological systems and collected her experiences in two books: Field Notes from a Catastrophe: Man, Nature, and Climate Change and The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History.
This book presents numerous facts and figures on how the sixth extinction event is ongoing. The last five extinction events were triggered by non-organic forces such as natural climate change or asteroid impacts.</description>
