<p><strong>Elizabeth Kolbert</strong>:  A journalist at <em>The New Yorker</em> who has travelled in many ecological
systems and collected her experiences in two books: <em>Field Notes from a
Catastrophe: Man, Nature, and Climate Change</em> and <em>The Sixth Extinction: An
Unnatural History.</em></p>
<p>This book presents numerous facts and figures on how the sixth extinction event
is ongoing. The last five extinction events were triggered by non-organic forces
such as natural climate change or asteroid impacts. Each of these were
characterized by large-scale damage to major life-forms. This may be the
first time a single species could make such a large-scale impact. We have already
made a mark in the
ecological history by being the cause of extinction for innumerable other
species. The book presents data from many places where scientists are busy
monitoring events at close range.</p>
<p>This book is <strong>not just about the modern issues of global warming</strong> and
ocean acidification, it is about so much more. The role of humans on the
ecological diversity started way before industralization. A trail of extinction
and bloodshed has followed homo sapiens across the globe. One
example is the rapid movements we have across continents. Prior to
industrialization, we hardly moved across continents. Now a new frog fungus
being carried with human transports takes just few decades (a tiny
moment in the ecological scale) to endanger every single frog species in the world.</p>
<p>The background rate of extinction is a keyword here. It is often expressed
in terms of extinctions per million species-years. At best, this number should be
such that among <em>&ldquo;group of fifty-five hundred mammal species wandering around
today&rdquo;&hellip;., &ldquo;one species to disappear every seven hundred years.&quot;</em> Extinction of a
species is a rare event for
somebody to witness in a lifetime, yet in the last 100-200 years, we have
recorded many animals go extinct in front of our eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Some scientists hold the opinion that an extinction event is far more disastrous
than what we are looking at.</strong> The start of a true extinction event will
probably already be out of control in ways we could not track or stop and will
affect a wider diversity. <em>That may be true</em>, but this theory does not deny the
impact we have made. We all agree that our chances of redressing the broken ecosystem
is diminishing with time.</p>
<p>Whether or not the sixth extinction has started, we are almost too late to
take action. This book shows that we are already running out of time. If we
fail to recognise our impact, we might just make an irreversible change to our own habitat.</p>
<p>One popular argument is that our view is anthropocentric. The argument goes on that
nature will just adapt with different set of flora and fauna to fit the new world. That may also be true. However, before our downfall, we are dooming all of the current biodiversity.</p>
<p>History has good evidence that human actions are significant at a worldwide
ecological scale. This fact may be depressing, but it also shows that we
also have the capacity to revert and make our world better for ourselves and other species.</p>
