			<p>At the start of 2020, I checked my typing speed and found that I was typing much slower than what I could. I was doing ~40 wpm at that time. As mostly a programmer, the longest that I have to type for work are specifications or the occasional blogs. I knew about touch typing but didn&rsquo;t find my typing method lacking even though I couldn&rsquo;t type a single sentence without looking down at the keyboard. While I will give more reasons for improving typing speed, I just liked a good personal challenge, a game to achieve higher scores.
Touch typing refers to a standard method of typing that assigns one finger to each letter to use all 10(really 8) of our fingers for faster typing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[wiki]</a></p>
<p>Getting better at anything requires <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2010/01/06/the-grandmaster-in-the-corner-office-what-the-study-of-chess-experts-teaches-us-about-building-a-remarkable-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deliberate practice</a> and I signed up on typing club and typeracer (mini reviews at the end) for some typing practice. I could never pick this up as habit but used this to fill downtime during the day. It is difficult to build a habit without a routine and this year has been particularly harsh for any kind of routines. I managed to sneak in some practice and learned touch typing. Apart from touch-typing, I also learned about several interesting things.</p>
<h2 id="1-no-one-really-goes-hunting-and-pecking">1. No one really goes hunting and pecking.</h2>
<p>When I first learned touch-typing, I had to give up my &ldquo;organically&rdquo; developed typing method. While the touch-typists might look down upon the rest of the world as hunting and pecking, the truth is no-one really does pecking. Over time, we develop our own reasonable typing methods. Maybe we take longer getting used to a new keyboard, but once used to it, we type reasonably fast, maybe with one or two peeks at the keyboard here and there. This meant that when I started touch-typing, I incurred a reduction in my typing speed which lasted almost two weeks. I should probably have practiced a bit more at that time to keep that even less.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6Ztr9s7vPAS8XtK0/giphy.mp4" alt="Slow typing GIF"></p>
<h2 id="2-we-type-words-not-letters">2. We type words, not letters.</h2>
<p>While I have mistyped <code>o</code> instead of <code>p</code>, <code>v</code> instead of <code>b</code> many times, I make such mistake a lot more when this letter is part of some uncommon word.
Once you get used to touch-typing, you forget about the individual fingers and start to just type letter combinations without thinking about it. I have the most common letter combinations in muscle memory such that I don&rsquo;t have to think about the typing. This also means it is more likely to make a letter typing mistake when the word has a not-so-common letter combinations. Even when I am copying from a given text and I know the spelling, I will make more errors if the word is uncommon. I have learned to slow down whenever there is any less common word.</p>
<h2 id="3-accuracy-is-the-prerequisite-to-speed">3. Accuracy is the prerequisite to speed.</h2>
<p>It is more important to focus on the accuracy and keep practising. When I was at 50 wpm, after regaining back my original speed and getting my first real improvements, I found that I was making almost 5% mistakes. If I typed slowly trying to reduce errors, my typing speed was actually higher than when I tried to type fast. At every level, whenever, I am stuck at a particular WPM for too long, I have switched my goals to getting 100% accuracy, forgetting about the speed. This meant that I learnt new letter combinations and it only improved my typing speed. If I let the errors stay, I will keep making the mistakes when those letter combinations come up. It is important to type calmly without rushing and making mistakes.

<h2 id="4-keyboards-matter-but-not-much">4. Keyboards matter, but not much.</h2>
<p>Mechanical keyboards are built such that every key press has an inflection point on the force vs distance graph that lets you know precisely when the key is registered. There is an audible or tactile feeling that you can&rsquo;t get on membrane keyboard. Inspite of all that, I don&rsquo;t think it affects the typing speed as long as you develop your muscle memory for common words. On other keyboards, I might make the mistake of leaving the key without pressing it full, but that is so rare that it doesn&rsquo;t matter unless you are above 100wpm already. It is so much more important to just practice accurately typing the 1000 most common words.
At this point, my typing speed is almost the same whether I type on the cherry MX brown or the membrane keyboard, or the Apple scissor switches. I am looking to get another keyboard, but that is for a smaller profile (60%) instead of changing the switch.</p>
<h2 id="5-programming-fast-no-but-yes">5. Programming fast? No, but yes</h2>
<p>Programmers know that typing fast does no good when your goal is to produce quality maintainable software. Programming requires more time looking at code than actually writing, and even more time going back to edit existing code. Add to that, programming requires so many special characters that any touch-typing goes out the window.
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26tn33aiTi1jkl6H6/giphy.mp4" alt="programming gif"></p>
<p>Still, there is something else about touch-typing that I feel is beneficial. Ever since, I have learned touch-typing, I don&rsquo;t have to look down at the keyboard at all. I never consciously looked down before either, but if I am typing in the dark without backlit keyboard, then I wouldn&rsquo;t finish a single sentence without making mistakes. Now, I feel like a thread in my brain is freed because I no longer have to look down or think about typing. It took some extra time to get used to typing the symbols with the little finger of the right hand.</p>
<p>I feel like there should be a better or a different had position for typing out the different brackets.  Turns out, there is a whole new layout called Programmer&rsquo;s Dvorak. It is very similar to Dvorak but the keys are optimised for programming instead of typing English.</p>
<h2 id="6-stenographers-keyboard">6. Stenographers keyboard:</h2>
<p>I thought 100 wpm was fast, but the leaderboards on any of those typing websites are filled with 200+ wpm scores. I learned that there is such a thing as a stenographer&rsquo;s keyboard. This keyboard can be used to type many times faster. What is even surprising is that it actually contains far fewer keys than a regular keyboard. With just 22 keys, stenographers can type upwards of 200 wpm.
Stenographers are the people who sit in courtrooms and transcribe what everyone says. They are required to type at the speed of speech using this special keyboard. The keys are split in two parts and most words can be formed with just 2 or 3 key press combinations. Below diagram will give an idea about how that works. Each key represents a sound instead of a letter.

<h2 id="7-200-most-common-vs-1000-more-common">7. 200 most common vs 1000 more common</h2>
<p>There are only a handful of words that comprise most of our day-to-day writing and typing fast requires memorising these top words to muscle memory. I can type most of the common words without thinking about the individual letters. Just like the common letter combinations, my fingers seem to remember when these words appear. Typing speed can be greatly improved if you practiced just these top words. 10fastfingers.com has a dedicated area where they let you practice only on the top 200 words or the top 1000 words as you want.
If this sounds interesting, read about Ziph&rsquo;s law.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCn8zs912OE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[vsauce video]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[wiki]</a> <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[simple wiki]</a> It states that given a large sample of words used, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. So word number n has a frequency proportional to 1/n.</p>
<h2 id="8-dvoraks-keyboard">8. Dvorak&rsquo;s keyboard:</h2>
<p>The QWERTY layout is the most common but is not the only one out there. This popular keyboard layout was designed around the purpose of not jamming a mechanical type-writer. In ye olden days, the keyboards were a bit-too-mechanical. It had metal levers attached to each key which would strike an ink ribbon against a paper such that the letter would be <em>stamped</em> on the paper. When typing fast, it was possible for these metal levers to collide and entangle leading to a jam. The keys on the type-writer were distributed in QWERTY pattern such that the levers related to each consecutive letters were mostly far apart to reduce jams.

<p>In 1936, August Dvorak decided to re-arrange the keys for human fingers instead of the machine. This new version of keyboard is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dvorak</a> and its proponents claim to have a much faster and better typing speed and experience. I plan to give this a try someday when I can afford to lose my typing speed and start hunting and pecking the keys for at least a month. The below image shows a comparison of the DVORAK layout vs the qwerty layout. Programmer&rsquo;s keyboard is another modified layout made for easily accessing the special characters that are so common in any programming language.

<h2 id="my-current-progress">My current progress</h2>
<p>So, after almost a year of occasional practice trying to improve my typing speed, I have learned a bit more than just touch-typing and overall, it has been a fun experience. I am a bit more confident on keyboard and I no longer need backlit keyboards.
My current typing speed varies from 65 to 80 wpm and I think this is fine for now.

<h2 id="mechanical-keyboard">Mechanical keyboard</h2>
<p>I have been rotating through different kinds of keyboards for some time. As a programmer, keyboard is probably my most important tool and I find it a worthwhile investment to keep looking for new keyboards. Till 2019, I was mostly going through regular membrane keyboards. I had tried <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000/b2m-00012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MS Ergo 4000</a> keyboard, but found it far too bulky and the keyboard clicking always felt a bit <em>muffled</em>. It sounds vague but the keys never felt like they registered. I was looking to upgrade to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/l5v-00001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its newer version</a> when I discovered the world of mechanical keyboard. It seemed more like an artisan hobby rather than a functional keyboard, but the online communities convinced me to give one of them a try. It certainly is a very niche community and there aren&rsquo;t many options on popular e-commerce websites in India. Mechanical keyboards are pricey, so I went for cherry MX because I didn&rsquo;t think that I will buy more than one. I needed a functional and generally acceptable brand to begin with. I got the <a href="https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/peripheral/keyboards/masterkeys-pro-l-white/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoolerMaster Cherry MX keyboard</a>.
<img src="https://media.kingston.com/hyperx/content/cherrymx-blue-chart.svg" alt="Force vs distance graph of tactile feedback in mechanical switches"></p>
<p>This market is mostly about gaming and if you are not a gamer, you will have to find specific parameters about what you are looking for. There are much advertised features that I don&rsquo;t care about such as n-key rollover and RGB lighting. Whether I am writing Javascript or English, I don&rsquo;t want RGB light flickering anywhere near me.</p>
<h3 id="websites">Websites:</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.typingclub.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Typing club</a>: The most useful one for me. It has lots of lessons and lots of practice texts. My only gripe was that it contains a lot of American proper nouns of people and places which I have no use practising. I could never type Wisconsin without making a mistake.</li>
<li><a href="https://play.typeracer.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TypeRacer</a>: It has a multi-player race mode which is always fun. It also lets you practise against a ghost of your own. This means that if I think I can do better on a text, then I can race against myself until I beat my current average. This practise of racing against myself until I get a score higher than my running average has drastically improved my speed. It makes you type words from popular books, movies, tv shows or sometimes songs. This makes it always the most fun out of the other websites and I have spent the most time on this one.</li>
<li><a href="https://10fastfingers.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10FastFingers</a>: The best part about this one is that it has separate tests for top 200 most common words and another for the top 1000 most common words. This is significant because most of our writing is about these common words. There are often some technical words that we have to type depending on our line of work, but those words get enough practised anyway. The problem with this one is that the words don&rsquo;t form sentences and that often makes me type incorrect words.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.keybr.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keybr.com</a>: This one has a very novel approach to finding your weakest fingers and letters. I had a problem mis-typing v and b, even though both letters are in my name. This website will make you practise each letter one after another until you have mastered it. However, I find it tiring and frustrating because I am not typing real words and that always feel extra effort. It keeps leading me to my worst letters and can force me to practice on <code>x</code> and <code>q</code> for hours. My approach towards this was more about as a fun game rather than a target to achieve, so this approach didn&rsquo;t work for me.</li>
<li>Extra mention: <a href="https://www.typelit.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Typelit.io</a> This website lets you type public-domain novels yourself such that you never feel like typing in short bursts of small paragraphs. Writing a longer block of text is the satisfying. Following the story makes you want to type faster and it doesn&rsquo;t get tiring.</li>
